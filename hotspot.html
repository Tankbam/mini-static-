<h2>Coney Island</h2>
<Article>
<p>
If you lived in New York City. You must heard of Coney Island.
 If you are a tourist then you must visit Coney Island. It is not only a literal beaches,but there also many tourist attractions such as amusement parks, aquarium, and etc.
 On the beach, you can just sit and relax under the warm sun while tucking your feet into the sand. Alternatively, you can go swimming in the water.
 Though you aren't a professional swimmers, I advice staying close to your family members while swimming.
